Welcome! I’m a Ph.D. candidate in Industrial Engineering at [Department of Industrial & Enterprise Systems Engineering](https://ise.illinois.edu/) and affiliated with [Coordinated Science Laboratory](https://csl.illinois.edu/), University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. I am supervised by Associate Professor [S. Rasoul Etesami](https://etesami.ise.illinois.edu/). From August 2024 to January 2025, I was a visiting scholar at [Engineering Systems and Design Pillar](https://www.sutd.edu.sg/esd/), Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD), hosted by Assistant Professor [Antonios Varvitsiotis](https://sites.google.com/site/antoniosvarvitsiotis/). Prior to these, I received B.Eng. in Civil Engineering (with First Class Honours) from The University of Hong Kong.

My research spans **game theory**, **online learning**, **social networks**, and **optimal control**. Specifically, my primary research interest lies in studying the equilibria of dynamic games and designing online learning algorithms for agents in multi-agent systems and networks using the techniques from game theory, optimization, multi-armed bandits and reinforcement learning, with a focus on strategic resource allocation. I am also interested in distributed systems and inverse game theory. 

I am a 2025-26 job market candidate!
